```

### 2. Component Creation and Organization
- **Total Components Created**: 35 components
- **Core Files**: 14 files (services, guards, interceptors, models)
- **Shared Components**: 10 components moved to shared directory
- **Feature Components**: 25 new components created across all features

### 3. File Structure Standardization
All components now follow the standard Angular structure:
```
component-name/
├── component-name.component.ts
├── component-name.component.html
└── component-name.component.scss
```

### 4. Import Path Updates
- Updated `app.routes.ts` to reflect new folder structure
- Updated `app.config.ts` to use new core interceptor path
- All component imports now use correct relative paths

### 5. Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Completely rewritten with new structure documentation
- **Architecture Guidelines**: Added comprehensive development guidelines
- **Naming Conventions**: Documented file and component naming standards
- **Folder Structure**: Detailed explanation of each directory's purpose

## 📊 Statistics

### Before Restructuring
